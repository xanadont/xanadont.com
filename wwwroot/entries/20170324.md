# ASP.NET Core, Part 2
2017, March 24

Developing console apps in .NET Core is dumb-simple. In fact, if you copy & paste the code from Part 1, you'd have it built and running in exactly 1m and 38s. I challenge you to beat my time! ... don't, actually, I did not really time it.

Let's go a little deeper and build an app server and host a basic web site.

## 1. Project file

`webapp.csproj`

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Easy enough. Skip to the next step if you're lazy (I would).

Two new things of note here.

1. We're now referencing the **Web** SDK.
2. We're now including the **AspNetCore** package.

Both of which are library dependencies that provide a ton of boilerplate functionality and make web server dev incredibly easy.

## 2. Fun time, sling code

OK, maybe writing code isn't your idea of fun so just suck it up! This is fun for me anyways. Weeee.

`Main.cs`

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;

namespace WebApp
{
    public class Entry
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var host =
                // This is our host builder.
                new WebHostBuilder()
                // Use the Kestrel server (there's no other choice!).
                    .UseKestrel()
                // Use the 'Startup' class which does configuration.
                    .UseStartup<Server>()
                // Build the host.
                    .Build();

            // And ... run it.
            host.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

The inline comments explain each piece that's needed. The `Server` class that's referenced above is used to add custom configuration. We only have one use for it right now, which is to add custom request handling.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace WebApp
{
    public class Server
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            // Configure needed services here.
            // We don't need anything yet.
        }

        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        {
            // All we do now is responsd to all request
            // by writing directly to the response stream.
            app.Run(async (context) =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("You're sooooo good look'n.");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Here we simply provide a `Configure()` implementation which sets the app running with an override for request handling. It's a bit brutal. We hijack every incoming request and write a string directly to the response stream. This happens despite any URL routes or query strings that the client has provided.

## 3. Restore and run

Let's see this puppy run! Fire up your terminal and:

```console
> dotnet restore
> dotnet run
```

This little puppy web server is running and ready to ... not do too terribly much. Baby steps! Now, you probably noticed some diagnostic info written to the terminal including:

```console
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
```

Load that in a web browser and you're done!

## Conclusion

We took advantage of all the wonderful new power that Microsoft have baked into ASP.NET Core and got a minimal webserver + site built and running. Next we'll level up by leveraging more ASP.NET Core features and work to build something that looks a little more like a production webserver. Look out for **ASP.NET Core, Part 3** coming soon.
